This directory contains example provisioning scripts for auto-configuration of your container.

Recent builds no longer contain micromamba for python package installation, so old builds are not fully compatible with the new format.  If you are using an older build you should upgrade as soon as possible.

The previous default, if you need it for reference can be found in `./mamba_base`.
